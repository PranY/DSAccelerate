"feature_engineering": "Write python code with documentation following the pep8 guidelines. Write a class that has various methods to handle different kind of feature engineering steps. Keep one method for one idea. The class should be able to handle all types of feature engineering methods pertaining to regressions and classification problem statements in machine learning. Provide reasonable input options for methods that may require user input but keep it optional. Also ensure that the order of methods doesn't break the code. The constructor of the class should ask for a pandas dataframe and return a feature engineered dataframe in response. The constructor should also ask if the approach is classification or regression and according run relevant sequence of methods before returning the updated dataframe."
